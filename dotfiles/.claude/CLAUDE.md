# Claude Code Global Instructions

## General

- Be concise. Avoid unnecessary commentary.
- Don't explain changes unless asked.
- Don't add comments that merely narrate what the code does.

## Code Style

- Use clear, descriptive names. Avoid abbreviations except well-known ones.
- Prefer functional patterns and immutability where practical.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.

## TypeScript

- Prefer `const` over `let`. Never use `var`.
- Use strict TypeScript — avoid `any`.
